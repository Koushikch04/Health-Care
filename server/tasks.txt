2.Error Handling for Date of Birth: You might want to check if the user is of an appropriate age (e.g., 13 years or older) based on your application's requirements.

4.Secure Storage: Ensure that any sensitive information (like JWTs) is stored securely on the client side (preferably in HttpOnly cookies rather than local storage).
